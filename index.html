          <h3>First Woman In Indian Go To Space</h3>
          <p>
            <b> 
                
Her first space mission began on 19 November 1997, as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight.
 Chawla was the first Indian woman to go in space. She spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space,
  "You are just your intelligence." She had traveled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around the Earth. On her first mission,
 Chawla traveled million miles in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than 376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space.
 During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which malfunctioned, 
 necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite.
  A five-month NASA investigation exonerated Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces 
  and the defined procedures of the flight crew and ground control. 
 After the completion of post-flight activities,
 Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station.

                 Harrison was approached by filmmakers to make a movie on Kalpana's life, but he refused because he prefers to keep their life private.
